This CI/CD architecture uses GitHub, TeamCity, and automated deployment to streamline the development and deployment of a web app. Developers push changes to the dev branch, which are then reviewed and merged into the main branch. TeamCity will then do a build process, running a series of build steps to ensure functionality of the project. Once successful, the application will be deployed and exposed via load balancer for users to access.

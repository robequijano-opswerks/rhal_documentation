## Using TeamCity the developers have set up a CI/CD system that handles the following: 

!!! abstract "Version Control management/Code Management"

    Using Git/Github to track the updates and changes of the project. Also used for collaboration purposes for the multiple developers 

!!! abstract "Automated Testing"

    Once developers made changes to the Github repository, TeamCity will be able to automatically run unit tests and rebuild the project. This will ensure that the changes made to the project will work well and won't continue upon failure

!!! abstract "Deployment"

    When all tests pass, TeamCity will now be able to automatically deploy the project to the live environment. The web application will now be accessible by the users.
